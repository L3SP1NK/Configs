# --- Shadows (Disable with shadow = false;)
# The shadow exclude options are helpful if you have shadows enabled.
# Due to the way compton draws its shadows, certain applications (Such as
# shaped windows, custom popups, non-standard toolkits) will have visual glitches.

# --- Fading (Disable with fading = false;)
